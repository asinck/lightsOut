This is a lights out program I wrote for fun: fun to program, and fun to play.

The goal of the game is to turn the lights (white squares) off (black). This is accomplished by clicking on the squares, which toggles that square and the vertically and horizontally adjacent squares. If a square is on the edge or in a corener, it only toggles squares that are available to be toggled; it doesn't wrap around the board.
