This is a lights out program I wrote for fun: fun to program, and fun to play.

The goal of the game is to turn the lights (white squares) off (black squares). This is accomplished by clicking on the squares, which toggles that square and the vertically and horizontally adjacent squares. If a square is on the edge or in a corner, it only toggles squares that are available to be toggled; it doesn't wrap around the board.

At the moment, the program supports changing the color of the squares; they can be either solid color or gradients. 

I have no clue if this program works on mac at all; provided the packages, it should launch, but I don't know if it will actually color the buttons. I also don't know if this would work at all on windows. This does work on Ubuntu, given the right packages.
